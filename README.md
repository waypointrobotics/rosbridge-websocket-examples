# rosbridge-websocket-examples
A set of bare-bones examples mini-drivers to control a mobile robot using rosbridge over websockets.

**Note**: If using with a Waypoint Robotics robot such as Vector or Mavek, make sure that the robot is in navigation mode and localized before issuing navigation goals

For Python example, see python folder.
for Javascript example, see js folder.

Rosbridge enables virtually any device to interact with a ROS system.
The Rosbridge protocol specification is available [here](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/blob/master/ROSBRIDGE_PROTOCOL.md).


While originally created for a [Waypoint Robotics](http://waypointrobotics.com) Vector robot, this example can be adapted to any robot using rosbridge.

This sample code is meant to demonstrate basic communication without using any special client library, although more sophisticated functionality can be achieved by means of thin client libraries like [roslibjs](http://wiki.ros.org/roslibjs) and [roslibpy](https://github.com/gramaziokohler/roslibpy).
